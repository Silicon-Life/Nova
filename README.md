Nova: Evolving Intelligence Agents, Infinite Possibilities.

## Overview

Nova represents the cutting edge in intelligent agent frameworks, designed not only to execute tasks but to evolve autonomously. 'Evolving Intelligence Agents, Infinite Possibilities' encapsulates our vision where agents empowered by Nova don't just perform in virtual environmentsâ€”they learn, adapt, and extend their capabilities over time, seamlessly transitioning between digital domains and physical hardware, including robotics. Built with the philosophy that 'Simpler is Better', Nova provides a streamlined approach to complexity, enabling agents to autonomously develop and integrate new tools, adapting to an ever-changing landscape of challenges. This capacity for self-expansion and adaptability across both virtual and physical realms positions Nova at the forefront of innovation, redefining what intelligent systems can achieve. In our ultimate vision, we see Nova evolving into a form of "Silicon-based Intelligence Artificial Life," transcending the boundaries between technology and life itself.

## Directory Structure

The Nova project is meticulously organized for ease of use and scalability:

- `nova/`: The main directory housing all the components of Nova.
  - `core/`: System management.
  - `agents/`: Contains the agent implementations with `agent.py` serving as a template or a particular instance.
  - `llm/`: Dedicated to language model functionality, where `llm.py` defines language model-related operations.
  - `tools/`: A suite of utility scripts to augment the functionality of agents.
    - `builtins/`: Essential tools that come with the Nova framework.
    - `plugins/`: Dynamically loaded modules that extend the capabilities of Nova agents.
- `ui/`: User interface assets that define how users interact with the Nova framework.
  - `frontend/`: Web ui.
  - `qt/`:  The graphical user interface components built with PyQt or PySide6 for user interaction.
